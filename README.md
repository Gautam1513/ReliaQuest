ReliaQuest Employee APIs

1. I have immplemented all the apis mentioned in EmployeeController which implements IEmployeeInterface.
2. JUnit Test cases have also been written. Have used Mockito annotations.
3. Have used logging as well using logback slf4j.
4. Have used restTemplate to call the downstream applicartion running at port 8112 and fetch all the data.
5. Have created Global Exception handelr using custom Exception EmployeeNotFound.
6. Have used proper API documentation at Controller and Service layer.
7. I have even tested out all the APIs using postman collections. I have attached all postman collections in the project "api" folder itself.
